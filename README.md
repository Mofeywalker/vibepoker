## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd vibepoker

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env.local

# Run the development server (starts both Next.js and PartyKit)
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Production Deployment

#### 1. Deploy PartyKit Server

```bash
npx partykit deploy
```

This will output your PartyKit server URL (e.g., `https://vibepoker.username.partykit.dev`).

#### 2. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

Set the following environment variable in Vercel:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTYKIT_HOST=vibepoker.username.partykit.dev
```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Create a Room** — Enter your name and click "Create Room"
2. **Share the Link** — Copy the room URL and share it with your team
3. **Set a Topic** — The host can set the story/task being estimated
4. **Vote** — Each participant selects their estimate card
5. **Reveal** — Once everyone has voted, the host reveals all cards
6. **Review Results** — See the distribution, average, median, and suggested value
7. **Accept** — The host accepts the final estimate (saved to history)
8. **New Round** — Start fresh or revote on the same topic

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```bash
# PartyKit host (local development)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTYKIT_HOST=localhost:1999

# Production: use your PartyKit deployment URL
# NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTYKIT_HOST=vibepoker.username.partykit.dev
```

## 🌍 Internationalization

The app automatically detects the user's browser language and supports:
- 🇬🇧 English (`en`)
- 🇩🇪 German (`de`)

Translation files are located in `messages/`.

## 🎨 Customization

### Card Values & Decks

Edit `src/types/index.ts` to customize the available decks or add new ones:

```typescript
export const DECKS = {
  fibonacci: ['0', '1', '2', '3', '5', '8', '13', '21', '34', '55', '89', '?', '☕'],
  // ... other decks
} as const;
```

Remember to update `party/vibepoker.ts` if you introduce non-numeric decks that require custom calculation logic.

## 🏛️ Architecture

VibePOKER uses a clean abstraction layer for real-time communication:

```
Next.js Client → RealtimeClient Interface → PartyKitClient → PartyKit Server
```

This architecture allows for:
- **Platform Independence** — Easy to switch real-time providers
- **Type Safety** — Fully typed event system
- **Testability** — Mock the real-time layer for testing
- **Vercel Compatibility** — PartyKit runs on Cloudflare Workers
